Changes for 2.1.2
=================
- Verified that everything still works in Liquibase 3.10.0

- Fixed an issue with include and includeAll changes inside databaseChangeLogs
  that have parameter maps (Issue #47)
  
Changes for 2.1.1
=================
- Added support for an undocumented ChangeSet attribute:  The XML uses
 `logicalFilePath`, the actual ChangeSet property is called `filePath`.  The 
 DSL now supports both. (Issue #45)
  
Changes for 2.1.0
=================
- Added support for Liquibase 3.7

Changes for 2.0.3
=================
- Changed the way strings are serialized when we run 'generateChangeLog'.  
  Instead of single quotes, we now use Groovy's triple quotes.  If a view or
  table remarks use multi-line definitions, or contain quotes themselves, the
  generated change logs will now work.  Thanks to Ethan Davidson
  (@ethanmdavidson) for the contribution (Issue #39)
  
- Unit tests now work on windows boxes (Issue #40).
   
Changes for 2.0.2
=================
- Changed the way we load changes.  We now look for all changes in the Liquibase
  registry instead of instantiating them directly.
  
- Added support for changes provided by extensions, with thanks to Amanuel Nega
  (@amexboy) (Issue #33)
  
Changes for 2.0.1
=================
- Updated the version of Groovy to 2.4.12 to remove the CVE-2016-6814
  vulnerability
  
Changes for 2.0.0
=================
- This DSL no longer has a transitive dependency on Liquibase itself.  **This is
  a breaking change!**  It is now up to you make sure Liquibase is on the 
  classpath, but you can now use whatever version of Liquibase you need. This
  resolves Issue 32.
  
Changes for 1.2.2
=================
- Added support for property tokens in `changeSet`, `include`, and `includeAll`
  attributes (Issue #26)
  
- Fixed a problem with file based attributes of the `column` method (Issue #22)
  with thanks to Viachaslau Tratsiak (@restorer)  
  
- Rollback changes that need access to resources, like `sqlFile` can find them
  (Issue #24)
 
- Explicitly set a value for the `output` change's `target` attribute if no
  value was given.  This is a workaround for a Liquibase bug. (Issue #28)
 
- Changed the way included files are found so that classpath resources can be
  used in Spring Boot applications (Issue #13)
   
Changes for 1.2.1
=================
- Fixed some issues with custom changes (Issue #5 and Issue #8) with thanks to 
  Don Valentino

  Gradle plugin repository)

Changes for 1.1.1
=================
- Updated the DSL to support Liquibase 3.3.5 (Issue 29 from the old repository)

- Fixed a `createProcedure` bug and added support for `dropProcedure` with 
  thanks to Carlos Hernandez (Issue #3)

Changes for 1.1.0
=================
- Refactored the project to fit into the Liquibase organization.

Changes for 1.0.2
=================
- Recompiled with `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` set so that
  the DSL works with older versions of Java (< JDK8)

Changes for 1.0.1
=================
- Updated the DSL to support Liquibase 3.3.2 (Issue #45 from the old repo)

- Updated the Groovy dependency to 2.4.1.
